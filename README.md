This is a [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io) workspace that allows for easy minecraft plugin development on-the-go via Gitpod

## How To Use
There is an example plugin in the ```plugin/src```, feel free to edit it. To run with a server, you can ```cd server && wget <server jar url here> -o server.jar```. To run with a Minecraft client, you could use [Gitpod Local Companion](https://www.gitpod.io/blog/local-app) to allow access to the TCP server, or use another tunneling tool, as Gitpod does not allow outside TCP connections.

## Maven Issues
